I now discuss my ongoing research work, as well as point out directions of
future research.
My ongoing research work that, once done, would be included in 
the final version of my dissertation contains the following components:

\begin{enumerate}  \itemsep -4pt
	\item Preference learning and approximation:
		\begin{itemize} \itemsep -5pt
			\item Learning forests of lexicographic preference trees.
			\item Approximating CP-nets using lexicographic preference trees.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Preference reasoning:
		\begin{itemize} \itemsep -5pt
			\item Aggregating partial lexicographic preference trees (PLP-trees).
			\item Preference misrepresenting in elections where votes are LP-trees or PLP-trees.
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Regarding future research directions, I will establish a research program of data-driven
preference engineering, including data-driven preference learning, and preference
reasoning and applications.

For data-driven preference learning, I plan to study methods and algorithms below.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Recommender Systems\cite{adomavicius2005toward}:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Collaborative
			\item Content-based
			\item Hybrid
		\end{itemize}
	\item Machine Learning (fitting function):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Supervised learning (e.g., decision trees, random forests)
			\item Label ranking\cite{hullermeier2008label}
		\end{itemize}
	\item Model-based Learning (learning interpretable decision models):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Preference Elicitation (Human-in-the-Loop)
			\item Conditional Preference Networks, Preference Trees
			\item Stochastic Models (e.g., Choquet integral\cite{tehrani2011choquistic}, 
						TOPSIS-like models\cite{agarwal2014preference})
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

For preference reasoning and applications, I propose to investigate both theoretic
and practical problems in areas as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Social Choice and Welfare\cite{arrow2010handbook,Brandt:COMSOC}:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Voting
			\item Fair division
			\item Strategy-proof Social Choice
		\end{itemize}
	\item Automated Planning and Scheduling\cite{son2006planning,bienvenu2011specifying,bast2015route}:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Travel scheduling
			\item Manufacturing
			\item Traffic control
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
