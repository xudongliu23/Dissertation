For my PhD dissertation I study problems in preference representation, 
reasoning and learning, when preferences concern outcomes ranging over
combinatorial domains.
Preference representation and reasoning is a major research 
area in artificial intelligence (AI) and decision theory, and is closely related to the 
social choice theory considered by economists and political scientists. In my research I 
will exploit emerging connections between preference reasoning in AI and social choice. 
My main focus is on preference representation languages extending and combining
formalisms such as conditional preference nets, lexicographic preference trees and answer-set 
optimization programs, on reasoning problems centered around preference optimization 
and strategy-proofness of preference aggregation methods, and on
learning problems that aim at discovering predictive preference information
from empirical data.
